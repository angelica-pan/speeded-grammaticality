<p> In this study, you'll be reading sentences presented rapidly in the center of the screen. Once the sentence is completed, a series of +++++ marks will appear on the screen. Your task is to indicate whether the sentence you just read is a grammatically acceptable sentence of English. A sentence is grammatically acceptable if you can interpret it as a sentence of English, regardless of how likely it might be. </p>
<p> You'll use the F key to indicate that the sentence is NOT OKAY and the J key to indicate that it was OKAY. Speed is important, so go with your first instinct. <b> Please respond as accurately and as quickly as you can. </b> </p>
<p> After some sentences, you will also see comprehension questions presented in all CAPS. We are more concerned about accuracy than speed for these questions, so please be sure to take your time to respond correctly. You will use the F or J key to select an answer. </p>
<p> You will have chances to take breaks throughout the experiment. </p>
